Alfworld with LLM
===
This work is to interact with [alfworld](https://github.com/alfworld/alfworld) using the LLM model provided by openai. 

I reference the code from [llm-dp](https://github.com/itl-ed/llm-dp) to build my own code.

Set UP
---
Install [alfworld](https://github.com/alfworld/alfworld) following its instruction. 

Using LLM to interact with the alfworld environment, no neural network needs to run in local environment, thus torch, cuda and other deep learning libraries are unnecessary. So it's easy to set up the environment.

``Python==3.7`` might be important though.

Run
---
    python myAgent.py
